== Summary ==
Definition files are plain text format files, which describe the format of a
specific WDB file format in four blocks, giving the parser information on
file signature, version, structure, and desired output format.

== Definition file format ==
 // A short header comment.
 // SampleCache.wdb - WSDB - 8606
 +signature
 WSDB
 +version
 8606
 +wdb
 s f s32 u32 b
 +sql
 INSERT INTO sample
 (title, vector, rating, amount, flags)
 VALUES
 ('$(1)', $(2), $(3), $(4), $(5)
 );

As you can see, the signature must match that of the WDB file; the WDB "type".

The version value must match the version of the WDB file. If these don't match,
it's possible that the structure of the WDB file may not be compatible with the
definition file structure. In the event that your WDB file version is newer than
your format file, you may simply update your structure file version value to the
WDB file version. This may work if the WDB structure hasn't changed. If it does
not you could always play with the WDB schema string within your format file
until it works.

The SQL schema which follows the +sql tag should be self explanatory, but some
points are worth mentioning:

* All string types automatically have their apostrophes quoted.
* This scheme line may contain several statements, and variables may be placed multiple times.
